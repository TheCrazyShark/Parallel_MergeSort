# Parallel_MergeSort

This project was done in order to test the time differences when utilizing both large and small datasets with a parallelized MergeSort algorithm against a standard non-parallelized MergeSort Algorithm.

Project was worked in a partnership of Chad Green, Joshua Gearhart, and Shane Smith.
